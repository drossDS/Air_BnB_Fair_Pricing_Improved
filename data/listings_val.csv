Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy.

We do use more Clorox for surface sanitization than normal cleaning, which unfortunately does comes with the smell of Hydrogen peroxide. And our unit does not have an HVAC system but in-wall AC.   

Here at Nora’s house, We run all our unit like hotel, with 24 hours on site assistant and all white linen and towel. My main task at the Nora house team is communication and concierge during day time.  

We have been renting through Airbnb for 2 years, and all of us really enjoyed hosting people from all walks of life. And profoundly appreciate the income generated by it to provide for our families

What differentiates us from other host are: we truly care about each guest. And we always try our very best to accommodate. We try to use as much white as we can in our units,  any dirt could be easily discovered. Instead of regular room cleaning that most airbnb host do, we also sanitize all surface with disinfection product in hotel standard. 

We set our automated pricing tool to be at least 20% lower than other similar Airbnb's in the area, and at least 40% lower than surrounding hotels. Please be considerate when using AC and leave the apartment in a manageable condition to help us keep the cost low.

A little about us! We've been in a lot of countries, love Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars (not the new ones lol), and any other nerdy stuff. We also like a lot Pearl Jam, Radiohead, and O.A.R. Diego met Eddie Vedder once outside Fenway Park. Lucky.

We have a dog called Birra, she's our angel. A King Charles Cavalier. If you ask us to send you a picture we may send you ten thousand. 

And we just just just had a baby! His name is Liam and he'll be our future rock star who will pay our bills when we are old. 

Our favorite city is Boston! And we've been in a lot of places!

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

The MBTA's Downtown Crossing subway station directly serves Downtown Crossing. The State Street and Park Street stations are within close walking distance. Silver Line service is also available.  You can get literally anywhere in the city for a few dollars and a Tpass.<br /><br />The apartment building is located on a dead end street which means it's super quiet for automobile traffic, but still has the lively city feel as foot traffic is sure to be noticeable any time of day, even in the winter.  The Boston Common is only a few hundred feet from the entrance to the building.<br /><br />Important to not",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-45675549/original/06619721-6b06-4b34-aba9-04cd6383ce4a.png,365116307,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/365116307,Brian + Heather,2020-08-30,"New York, NY","Hi, we're Heather Steven, and Brian!

Thanks for looking up my listing, I hope you like what you see. 

I currently host in Providence, RI. My home is in a diverse and historic neighborhood. 
The home was built in 1910, it is large, welcoming and clean. 
It  has 3 stories, 6 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms & multiple common areas. Plenty of room to socialize if you wish so, or to keep to oneself if preferred. 
Whatever you do, please be kind, clean and considerate. 

I typically spend my week days in Boston and my weekends in Providence. When not in Boston or Providence, I can be found on photo assignments around New England or playing with pups! When not playing with pups, on assignments or hosting, I may be found roaming the the world. My favorite part of the world is South East Asia (I've spent multiple Winters in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, China, Myanmar, India, The Philippines and Indonesia to name a few ;)). More recent trips have taken me to Guadeloupe, Panama, Colombia and various other Central and South American countries. I grew up in Europe and speak French, Spanish and English and understand, or have notions of, a few other languages. I love discovering new cultures & meeting new people. 

I started hosting in 2016 and I’m loving it and  the chance to meet & host people from all corners of the world and walk of life! 

Your comfort & happiness under my roof (and out of the home) during your visit are very important to me; I always thrive to please my guests and, hopefully, surpass their expectations whenever I can! :) 

I adore pets and occasionally swing by with a furry friend or two. I allow up to two pet guests at a time. Please do not book with me if you have allergies or do not enjoy sharing your home with pets. I may or may not have furry friends during your visit. 

It is important to me that my guests are clean, kind, mature, considerate, respectful and friendly. No party, no loud anything and no smoking at the home please. Music/musicians and fun conversations are always welcome on the other end (but not expected). 

I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully hosting you soon; don't hesitate to reach out or ask anything. :) ",within a few hours,90%,50%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/54a6ec39-8cd7-4e39-a151-2a955ced23d8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/54a6ec39-8cd7-4e39-a151-2a955ced23d8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,13,19,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States",Dorchester,,42.29345,-71.06592,Private room in rental unit,Private room,2,,1 shared bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Wifi"", ""Stove"", ""Kitchen"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Free street parking"", ""First aid kit"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Iron"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Washer"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Cleaning available during stay"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""TV"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Shampoo"", ""Bed linens"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Backyard"", ""Oven"", ""Host greets you"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Essentials"", ""Hot water"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Hangers"", ""Dryer"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Heating"", ""Microwave""]",$69.00,150,365,150.0,150.0,365.0,365.0,150.0,365.0,,t,29,59,89,269,2023-03-19,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,f,3,0,3,0,

Thanks for looking up my listing, I hope you like what you see. 

I currently host in Providence, RI. My home is in a diverse and historic neighborhood. 
The home was built in 1910, it is large, welcoming and clean. 
It  has 3 stories, 6 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms & multiple common areas. Plenty of room to socialize if you wish so, or to keep to oneself if preferred. 
Whatever you do, please be kind, clean and considerate. 

I typically spend my week days in Boston and my weekends in Providence. When not in Boston or Providence, I can be found on photo assignments around New England or playing with pups! When not playing with pups, on assignments or hosting, I may be found roaming the the world. My favorite part of the world is South East Asia (I've spent multiple Winters in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, China, Myanmar, India, The Philippines and Indonesia to name a few ;)). More recent trips have taken me to Guadeloupe, Panama, Colombia and various other Central and South American countries. I grew up in Europe and speak French, Spanish and English and understand, or have notions of, a few other languages. I love discovering new cultures & meeting new people. 

I started hosting in 2016 and I’m loving it and  the chance to meet & host people from all corners of the world and walk of life! 

Your comfort & happiness under my roof (and out of the home) during your visit are very important to me; I always thrive to please my guests and, hopefully, surpass their expectations whenever I can! :) 

I adore pets and occasionally swing by with a furry friend or two. I allow up to two pet guests at a time. Please do not book with me if you have allergies or do not enjoy sharing your home with pets. I may or may not have furry friends during your visit. 

It is important to me that my guests are clean, kind, mature, considerate, respectful and friendly. No party, no loud anything and no smoking at the home please. Music/musicians and fun conversations are always welcome on the other end (but not expected). 

I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully hosting you soon; don't hesitate to reach out or ask anything. :) ",within a few hours,90%,50%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/54a6ec39-8cd7-4e39-a151-2a955ced23d8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/54a6ec39-8cd7-4e39-a151-2a955ced23d8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,13,19,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States",Dorchester,,42.31955,-71.05792,Private room in rental unit,Private room,2,,1 shared bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Wifi"", ""Stove"", ""Kitchen"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Free street parking"", ""First aid kit"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Iron"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Washer"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Shower gel"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""TV"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Shampoo"", ""Bed linens"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Backyard"", ""Oven"", ""Host greets you"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Microwave"", ""Pocket wifi"", ""Essentials"", ""Hot water"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Hangers"", ""Dryer"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Heating"", ""Fire extinguisher""]",$68.00,91,365,91.0,91.0,365.0,365.0,91.0,365.0,,t,26,56,86,361,2023-03-19,4,0,0,2017-05-17,2018-04-18,5.0,5.0,4.75,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.75,,f,3,0,3,0,0.06

My large family are all long-time Boston residents, and most of the members still own apartments from when they lived in downtown Boston.  All of my condo's are owned by members of my family.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

We Are Fully Aware of the Covid-19 in the Boston area, and we have completely enhanced our cleaning and sanitization process after each guest. We do use more Clorox for surface sanitization than normal cleaning, which unfortunately does comes with the smell of Hydrogen peroxide. And our unit does not have an HVAC system but in-wall AC.   

Here at Nora’s house, We run all our unit like hotel, with 24 hours on site assistant and all white linen and towel. My main task at the Nora house team is communication and concierge during day time.  

We have been renting through Airbnb for 2 years, and all of us really enjoyed hosting people from all walks of life. And profoundly appreciate the income generated by it to provide for our families

What differentiates us from other host are: we truly care about each guest. And we always try our very best to accommodate. We try to use as much white as we can in our units,  any dirt could be easily discovered. Instead of regular room cleaning that most airbnb host do, we also sanitize all surface with disinfection product in hotel standard. 

We set our automated pricing tool to be at least 20% lower than other similar Airbnb's in the area, and at least 40% lower than surrounding hotels. Please be considerate when using AC and leave the apartment in a manageable condition to help us keep the cost low.

Thanks for checking out my properties!  

My name is Dawn and I have been living in beautiful historical Charlestown for the last 16 years. My property is near and dear to my heart as this was my grandparents home that I pretty much grew up in and that I bought after they passed away. I recently decided to turn my beautiful peice of property into a place where visitors can come and enjoy all this wonderful city has to offer while staying in a place of history vs a hotel!  You will enjoy staying here and all this city has to offer_ I will make sure of it!  :)

I love living in the city, but also enjoy getting away for work or visiting my husband’s relatives in Greece.

I have been renting my apartments for decades, although furnished now, I know how important it is to make your stay easy and comfortable. Your accommodations are exactly as advertised. The amenities are as luxurious as our former wonderful guests specify. The apartment is short term rental specifically designed for your total comfort. As our guests mentioned ""The pictures don’t do it any justice.""

My husband Alex and I take the feedback we have gotten from our initial guests very seriously, and have implemented all suggestions to improve the apartment and the experience…. Even though all of our reviews are very positive, we strive to always improve ourselves and our apartments.

As a host, we will be as involved with your trip as much as you want. If you would like to get recommendations as to where to go, what to do, and places to eat we will most certainly help you with that, but if you rather be left alone, we will let you enjoy your privacy of your own apartment while visiting Boston.

Enjoy your visit to Boston and when you are finished with your day of tourism or work, you can return to your rental home. REST and RELAX in a clean and well-appointed apartment. The goal is that you have a worry free and comfortable stay. 

Welcome to Boston and its historic South End!

Sincerely,
Stephanie & Alex

We have been renting through Airbnb for 2 years, and all of us really enjoyed hosting people from all walks of life. And profoundly appreciate the income generated by it to provide for our families

What differentiates us from other host are: we truly care about each guest. And we always try our very best to accommodate. We try to use as much white as we can in our units,  any dirt could be easily discovered. Instead of regular room cleaning that most airbnb host do, we also sanitize all surface with disinfection product in hotel standard. 

We set our automated pricing tool to be at least 20% lower than other similar Airbnb's in the area, and at least 40% lower than surrounding hotels.

We Are Fully Aware of the Covid-19 in the Boston area, and we have completely enhanced our cleaning and sanitization process after each guest. We do use more Clorox for surface sanitization than normal cleaning, which unfortunately does comes with the smell of Hydrogen peroxide. And our unit does not have an HVAC system but in-wall AC.   

Here at Nora’s house, We run all our unit like hotel, with 24 hours on site assistant and all white linen and towel. My main task at the Nora house team is communication and concierge during day time.  

We have been renting through Airbnb for 2 years, and all of us really enjoyed hosting people from all walks of life. And profoundly appreciate the income generated by it to provide for our families

What differentiates us from other host are: we truly care about each guest. And we always try our very best to accommodate. We try to use as much white as we can in our units,  any dirt could be easily discovered. Instead of regular room cleaning that most airbnb host do, we also sanitize all surface with disinfection product in hotel standard. 

We set our automated pricing tool to be at least 20% lower than other similar Airbnb's in the area, and at least 40% lower than surrounding hotels. Please be considerate when using AC and leave the apartment in a manageable condition to help us keep the cost low.
